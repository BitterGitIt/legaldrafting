# legaldrafting

## Simple story

I'm inspired by <https://github.com/flotob/legalmarkdown> and <https://github.com/compleatang/legal-markdown> to attempt a plaintext legal drafting workflow, to avoid the mire of Microsoft Word formatting and focus on the drafting.

I'm interested in github as a change tracking tool too.

One concern, will any time saved by avoiding Word be more than blown learning the ins and outs of markdown and all?!

Will I even have time outside of my busy law job and family life?

We shall see.
